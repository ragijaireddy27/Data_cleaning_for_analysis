# Data Cleaning Portfolio Project

Welcome to my **Data Cleaning Portfolio Project**! This repository showcases various data cleaning techniques applied across different platforms such as **Excel**, **MySQL**, **Power BI**, and **Python**. The project focuses on preparing datasets by handling missing values, duplicates, and outliers, ensuring the data is ready for further analysis or visualization.

## Projects Overview

### 1. **Data Cleaning in Excel**
- In this section, data cleaning tasks are performed using Excel, focusing on tasks like removing duplicates, filling missing values, and correcting data inconsistencies.
- **File**: `cleaning_data_in_excel.xlsx`

### 2. **Data Cleaning in MySQL**
- This section demonstrates how SQL queries are used to clean data in MySQL. The queries focus on removing duplicates, handling null values, and converting data types to make the dataset ready for analysis.
- **File**: `data_cleaning_in_mysql.sql`

### 3. **Data Cleaning with Power Query in Power BI**
- This file shows how Power Query in Power BI is used for transforming and cleaning data. It includes steps like removing invalid rows, handling missing values, and applying necessary transformations.
- **File**: `product_data_modified_with_power_query_in_power_bi.pbix`

### 4. **SQL Queries for Data Cleaning**
- A collection of SQL queries for cleaning various datasets, including handling missing values, correcting inconsistencies, and optimizing data for analysis.
- **File**: `Data_Cleaning_Portfolio_Project_Queries.sql`

### 5. **Data Cleaning with Python (Jupyter Notebook)**
- This section includes Python scripts for cleaning and transforming data using libraries like Pandas and NumPy. The notebook demonstrates handling missing values, removing duplicates, and converting data types.

## Dataset

The datasets used in this project have been cleaned and transformed using the tools mentioned above. Each file demonstrates how to handle various data cleaning tasks and prepare datasets for further analysis.

## Technologies Used

- **Excel**: Used for basic data cleaning, such as filling missing values and removing duplicates.
- **MySQL**: Used for cleaning and transforming data using SQL queries.
- **Power BI (Power Query)**: Used for data transformation and cleaning in Power BI.
- **Python (Pandas, NumPy)**: Used for cleaning and preprocessing data in Jupyter Notebooks.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Used for running Python-based data cleaning scripts.

## Workflow

1. **Data Cleaning in Excel**: Basic cleaning tasks like removing duplicates and filling missing values.
2. **Data Cleaning in MySQL**: SQL queries to handle missing values, correct data inconsistencies, and prepare the data.
3. **Power Query in Power BI**: Using Power Query to transform and clean data for analysis.
4. **Data Cleaning in Python**: Using Python (Pandas/NumPy) to clean, handle missing data, and transform datasets.
